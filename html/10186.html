		<p class="title">The Van Gogh Studio Practice Research Project</p>
		<p class="venue">Germany, Netherlands, Portugal, United Kingdom, U.S.A.</p>
		<p class="date">2009–2013</p>
		<div class="Description">In 2009, a conservator from The Metropolitan Museum of Art was invited to join the Van Gogh Studio Practice Research Project based on her discovery and research of a previously unknown ink that Van Gogh used during his Arles period, and her expertise in pastels and chalks. Launched in 2005, the project, which is supported by Shell Oil, draws together an international team of conservators, scientists, curators, and scholars to study all aspects of Van Gogh’s working process and the materials he used. It seeks to identify his complex array of materials and practices, his sources of supplies and information (such as artisans, treatises, colleagues), contemporary artists using similar materials, developments in the science of synthetic paint and ink manufacture that impacted his work, identification of materials he used that have altered in color or composition over the course of time, and his studio props.

		<div class="Description"><strong>The Two Tombs of Senenmut (TT 71, TT 353)</strong>
<br /><br />
During the 1926–27 field season, the Metropolitan Museum's excavators discovered the entrance of a tomb. Inside they found a sketch of the tomb's owner, who was identified as the steward of Amun, Senenmut, one of the most influential courtiers in the reign of the female pharaoh Hatshepsut. This tomb, located north of the causeway leading to Hatshepsut's temple at Deir el-Bahri, was part of an extraordinary funerary monument that Senenmut prepared for himself in western Thebes. The tombs of most New Kingdom officials had a chapel for funerary offerings that was connected by a shaft or sloping corridor to the burial chamber. Senenmut separated these two essential elements. The Deir el-Bahri tomb (TT 353) was designed for his burial, and his offering chapel (TT 71) was cut into the prominent hill of Sheikh Abd el-Qurna some distance away on the south side of Hatshepsut's causeway.
<br /><br />
Senenmut's offering chapel was already known to Egyptologists. However, during the 1930–31 season, Metropolitan Museum Egyptologist Herbert Winlock cleared debris from the ruined structure and studied it more carefully. The chapel revealed some singular architectural features, including a statue carved into a deep niche above the facade. This depicts Senenmut with Hatshepsut's daughter Neferure, whom he served as tutor.
<br /><br />
<strong>The Tomb of Senenmut's Parents, Hatnefer and Ramose</strong>
<br /><br />
In 1936, the Metropolitan Museum Egyptian Expedition cleared the hillside below Senenmut's offering chapel (TT 71). Beneath the debris, they found a number of individual burials as well as a sealed doorway that opened into a burial chamber prepared by Senenmut for his elderly mother Hatnefer. The tomb was equipped with food, wine, linens, and personal posessions to accompany Hatnefer into the afterlife. It was also the final resting place of a number of Senenmut's relatives who had died when the family was less prosperous and been transferred to Thebes from another cemetery. These included his father, Ramose, three young women, and three children.
<br /><br />
Some of the provisions in Hatnefer's tomb came from royal storerooms and had the seal of Hatshepsut as queen. Other objects had the cartouche of Maatkare, the throne name Hatshepsut took when she became pharaoh and co-ruler with her nephew, Thutmose III. These and other inscriptions suggested to Winlock that Hatshepsut had adopted the names and titles of a pharaoh between the second and seventh years of her nephew's reign.
<br /><br />
The Museum's share of the finds from these tombs and the surrounding areas are on view in Egyptian gallery 116.

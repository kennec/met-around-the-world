		<div class="Description">The city of Nishapur in northeastern Iran was founded around the fourth century A.D., grew to prominence in the eighth century, and was destroyed by invasions and earthquakes in the thirteenth century. After that time, a much smaller settlement was established north of the ancient town, and the once bustling metropolis lay underground—until a team from The Metropolitan Museum of Art arrived there in the mid-twentieth century. Prior to this time, little was known about the physical nature of the city, but the Museum’s excavators revealed several sections of the city, including such monuments as a grand mosque, palaces, public buildings, baths, and a residential quarter. The excavations also uncovered pottery, some in styles unique to the city, as well as works in glass, metal, and numerous household items. The Museum’s work at Nishapur was made possible through a reciprocal agreement with the Iranian government, which allowed foreign excavators to work in Iran and to receive a share of the finds for their home countries so long as half of the excavated material was given to a local museum. Thus, some 1,500 objects came to the Metropolitan Museum, while an equal number went to the Muze Iran Bastan in Tehran.

		<div class="title">Cemetery of El-Bagawat and Ain et-Turba, Kharga Oasis</div>

		<div class="Description">In February 1908, the Egyptian Expedition of the Metropolitan Museum began the investigation of a large Christian cemetery, known as El-Bagawat, northeast of the temple of Hibis in Kharga Oasis. Work at the site was carried out by Museum curator Albert Lythgoe, assisted by Arthur M. Jones and Museum Egyptologist Herbert E. Winlock.
<br /><br />
The Metropolitan Museum carried out only one season of excavations in the cemetery of El-Bagawat, but as complete a photographic record as possible was made of the decorated tomb chapels and other ruins scattered over the northern part of the Oasis. About twenty years later, Charles K. Wilkinson of the Egyptian Expedition's Graphic Section returned to the site and produced a number of color facsimiles of the decoration in several of the chapels.
<br /><br />
The cemetery consists of about 200 brick chapels, partially arranged in "streets." The buildings are extraordinary well preserved and mainly show a square plan and are roofed with a dome on pendentives. A few chapels have a more elaborate ground plan. The exterior exhibits a mixture of pharaonic and classical architectural elements. The surfaces are plastered and in several cases painted, especially the interior of the cupolas. The paintings include allegorical and biblical personages and biblical scenes.
<br /><br />
About 100 graves were excavated that produced pottery and personal items. A small mound near the cemetery, known as Ain et-Turba, was also excavated and this contained the ruins of houses that yielded ostraca, glassware, and coins dating from the reign of Constantine the Great to Arcadius (A.D. 324–408), thus giving a rough time frame for the occupation of the settlement. Some of the objects that came to the Museum in the division of finds are now on view in the Mary and Michael Jaharis Byzantine Egyptian gallery (302).

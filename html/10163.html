		<div class="Description">Howard Carter and the Earl of Carnarvon had been excavating in the Valley of the Kings for a number of years when Carter uncovered the steps leading to the tomb of Tutankhamun in November 1922. Although Carter had suspected the existence of this tomb, he had no way of knowing what a wealth of material it would contain and he quickly realized that he would need assistance in recording and studying so significant a find. As the crow flies, the Valley of the Kings is only a few hundred yards behind the desert cliffs of Deir el-Bahri, where the Museum's Egyptian Expedition was at work. Among the Expedition's staff members was Harry Burton, who was already well known for his skill as an archaeological photographer, and Carter cabled the Museum's Egyptian Department asking for Burton's assistance. The Department's head, Albert M. Lythgoe, immediately replied, "Only too delighted to assist in every possible way. Please call upon Burton and any other member of our staff." In the end, Burton, archaeologist Arthur C. Mace, and two draftsmen, Lindsley F. Hall and Walter Hauser, worked with Carter on the recording and clearance of the tomb.
<br /><br />
Burton's photographs are an invaluable resource for the study of Carter's unique discovery of Tutankhamun's nearly intact royal tomb. Some images record the archaeological find, showing the locations of the objects within the tomb, or within the containers that held them. These photographs allow Egyptologists to re-create the final context of each piece. Other photos record the individual objects, often in a number of views, after they were removed from the tomb. These provide important documentation of the condition of the objects when they were found and will always be useful tools for conservation purposes. Another group of photographs tell the story of the find, or suggest events that took place long ago, during the burial of the young king, or when the tomb was reentered in ancient times.
<br /><br />
Between 1922 and 1932, while Tutankhamun's tomb was being cleared, Burton took several thousand photographs of the tomb and its contents. Two nearly identical sets of negatives were made: one set was given to Howard Carter and is now in the Griffith Institute of the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford; the second set is part of the archive of the Egyptian Expedition at The Metropolitan Museum of Art.

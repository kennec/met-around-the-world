 				<p class="title">Advisory Panel, Georgian National Museum, reinstallation of medieval collections</p>
<p class="venue"></p> <p class="country">Georgia</p> <p class="date">2010–2011</p>		<div class="Description">The Director of the Georgian National Museum, David Lordkipanidze, invited a team of the Metropolitan Museum staff to Tbilisi to advise on the reinstallation of the National Museum’s galleries of medieval art, one of the most important aspects of the national collections. A former fellow at the Metropolitan Museum developed the project “Reconstructing the Past—Tradition and Transformation: Reinstallation of the Medieval Collections of the Georgian National Museum,” using the Metropolitan Museum’s Mary and Michael Jaharis Galleries of Byzantine Art as the conceptual and design model. The participation of the Met’s team of a curator, a conservator, and an exhibition designer who had worked on the Jaharis galleries is funded by a UNESCO Participation Programme Grant. During their first two visits to the Georgian National Museum in Tbilisi, the Met’s representatives have held conservation workshops and gallery concept and installation discussions with members of the National Museum staff. The Met team also presented papers on their fields of expertise at symposia sponsored by the director of the National Museum. The Metropolitan Museum’s participation was followed with interest in the local press.

		<p class="date">1906–1922, 1991</p>
		<div class="Description">The pyramid complex of Amenemhat I was initially explored in 1894–95 by a French team led by J.-E. Gautier. The Metropolitan Museum team, under the direction of Museum curator Albert Lythgoe and Arthur Mace, worked at the site between 1906 and 1922. In 1991, unexcavated portions of the site were opened and some previously explored areas were reexamined. Objects in the Metropolitan Museum that originate from the Amenemhat I complex are found in galleries 103, 108, 109, and 113. They include some reused Old Kingdom blocks (see below), relief blocks from the temple of Amenemhat I, and the funerary outfit of the lady Senebtisi.
<br /><br />
Two settlements arose in the area: an earlier one around the pyramid built during the Middle Kingdom and a Ramesside town built on the ruins of the pyramid itself. The area seems to have been inhabited well into the New Kingdom. Study of the area has yielded valuable information about houses and workshops during these periods.
<br /><br />
<strong>Background</strong>
<br /><br />
The pharaoh Amenemhat I (ca. 1981–1952 B.C.) was the first ruler of Dynasty 12, a key era of ancient Egypt's Middle Kingdom. One of Amenemhat I's achievements was the establishment of a new capital city at Itj-tawy ("Seizer of the Two Lands"), which was located in the vicinity of the modern village of Lisht, about 25 miles south of Cairo. Amenemhat I constructed his pyramid in the area of his capital city. During the preceding Dynasty 11, political power was centered far to the south in the area of Thebes (modern Luxor).
<br /><br />
The centerpiece of the complex was the king's limestone pyramid. A sloping passage and shaft on its north side led to the burial chamber; a shaft in the floor of the chamber ends in groundwater. A small chapel was built against the entrance to the burial chambers on the north side of the pyramid. A temple was constructed on the east side of the pyramid. On the west side were ten shafts believed to have been used to inter women of the royal family; all were robbed in ancient times. High-ranking individuals of Amenemhat I's court were also buried around the pyramid complex. These tombs are an important source for understanding the development of Middle Kingdom burial practices. Of particular interest are the objects and jewelry found in the intact burial of the lady Senebtisi.
<br /><br />
During Amenemhat I's reign, pyramid building was revived after an approximately 150-year hiatus. At least part of the complex was constructed with the blocks from disassembled Old Kingdom royal monuments, including structures built by the pharaohs Khufu, Khafre, Userkaf, Unis, and one of the kings named Pepi. The builders probably used this material in order to speed construction of the complex. Amenemhat I's builders also appear to have reused blocks from an earlier structure built by Amenemhat I himself.

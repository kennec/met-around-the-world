 				<p class="title">The Dresden State Art Collections / The Metropolitan Museum of Art Staff Exchange Program</p>
<p class="venue"></p> <p class="country">Germany</p> <p class="date">2005â€“2010</p>		<div class="Description">Through The Dresden State Art Collections / The Metropolitan Museum of Art Staff Exchange Program, curators have conducted research in their areas of expertise and together have studied the rich collections of paintings, drawings, and prints. A significant discovery was made by a Met curator who traveled to Dresden to research sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Italian drawings. During her time spent in the study room at the Staatliche Museen, she unearthed a drawing by the young Raphael that was subsequently published in <em>Apollo Magazine</em> and <em>The Burlington Magazine</em>.

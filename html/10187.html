		<p class="title">Workshop on Textile Documentation and Preservation</p>
		<p class="venue">Egypt</p>
		<p class="date">January 17–29, 2010</p>
		<div class="Description">A workshop, "Textile Documentation and Preservation," organized by Museum & Art Advisory, LLC with The Metropolitan Museum of Art, was held January 17–29, 2010, at the Coptic Museum, Cairo. Funding was provided by an anonymous donor. Seven conservators, drawn from the Coptic Museum (2), the Islamic Museum (2), the Egyptian Museum (2), and the Manial Palace (1), were selected to participate in this program and to specialize in textile conservation.
<br /><br />
The Metropolitan Museum sent a senior conservator from the Department of Textile Conservation to teach the principles of textile conservation. During the course of this workshop, there were extensive discussions of the documentation, analysis, and storage of Late Antique textiles. Lectures provided the necessary theoretical background. Practical experience was gained through the actual examination of textiles from the collection of the Coptic Museum. Exercises enhanced the students' understanding of making storage mounts for fragile textiles, and work in storerooms highlighted the importance of monitoring environmental conditions. Also instructive were visits to local museums, conservation laboratories, and weaving centers. After completion of the workshop, participants were better prepared to care for their respective textile collections.
<br /><br />
Efforts are ongoing to continue this program to improve the conservation of Egypt's remarkable textiles.

		<div class="Description">The city of Ctesiphon, 20 miles south of Baghdad in Iraq, flourished for more than 800 years as the capital of the last two dynasties ruling the ancient Near East—the Parthians and the Sasanians—before the Islamic conquest in the seventh century. Identified by the British traveler and scholar Claudius James Rich in the early nineteenth century, systematic excavations at Ctesiphon were undertaken by an expedition in 1928–29 sponsored by the German Oriental Society. In 1931–32, The Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Staatliche Museen, Berlin, undertook a joint expedition for one season under the direction of Ernst Kühnel, with Walter Hauser and Joseph M. Upton representing the Metropolitan. Ctesiphon was home to one of the marvels of the ancient world, the fabled palace of the Sasanian emperor Khusrau I (r. 531–79). Remains of its legendary vaulted throne hall, housing the largest parabolic barrel vault in the world—built without centering—still exist today. Among the finds from the site are a collection of stucco reliefs with floral, geometric, and figural designs that offer insight into the iconography and style of Sasanian architectural decoration. A selection of the stucco reliefs are on display in the Metropolitan.

		<div class="title">Camel Caravan from Kharga Oasis to Dakhla Oasis</div>

		<p class="date">1908</p>
		<div class="Description">In May 1908, Metropolitan Museum Egyptologist Herbert E. Winlock and Arthur M. Jones undertook a camel trip from the Kharga project, exploring for three weeks the western Egyptian desert from Kharga to Dakhla Oasis. The caravan included five Arabs and ten camels. The area was not completely unknown, but the ancient sites, monuments, and rock inscriptions along the route were practically unrecorded. Winlock visited and recorded the temples of Deir el-Hagar, 'Ain Amur, 'Ain Tabshir, and Tenida, and visited the Roman sites of Smint el-Kharab, Sioah, Amhada, El-Qasr, and others. The expedition also recorded rock drawings along the Darb el-Ghub√¢ri.
<br /><br />
Compared to the unlimited facilities and higher standards of modern desert exploration, the enterprise was necessarily a rather modest one. Although the results were not published until 1936, they helped draw the attention of other archaeologists to these vast and totally unexplored sites, which are now more thoroughly studied, mainly by Canadian and French missions. Since then, the oases have grown into cities, and sites such as the temple of Deir el-Hagar have become the destination of organized desert tours.</div>

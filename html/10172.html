		<div class="Description">The site of Tell ed-Duweir, in modern-day Israel, was identified as the ancient city of Lachish in 1929 by the celebrated American archaeologist and biblical scholar William Albright. The site was excavated by the British Wellcome-Marston Archaeological Research Expedition under the direction of James Leslie Starkey from 1932 to 1938. Harris Dunscombe Colt, who later founded the Colt Archaeological Institute, was a member of the Expedition for the first season. He and his father Harris D. Colt also provided financial support in the form of a gift to the Metropolitan Museum for its contribution to the expedition. Remains from the Chalcolithic through the Hellenistic period (ca. 5000–100 B.C.) are evidenced at Tell ed-Duweir. The large fortified town, constructed early in the first millennium B.C., was the second most important city of the kingdom of Judah. It was destroyed in 701 B.C., when the Assyrian army, led by Sennacherib, stormed its walls, a fate that is chronicled in the Bible and represented in wall reliefs from the Assyrian palace at Nineveh.

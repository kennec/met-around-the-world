		<div class="Description">Al-Hiba (ancient Lagash), one of the largest mounds in southern Iraq, was first investigated in 1887 by the German architect and archaeologist Robert Koldewey. In 1968, a joint expedition of The Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Institute of Fine Arts of New York University, under the direction of Vaughn E. Crawford and Professor Donald P. Hansen, initiated excavations at the site. Excavations covered only a small part of the site, revealing occupation dated to the Early Dynastic period, ca. 2900–2350 B.C., when al-Hiba, along with Tello (ancient Girsu), were the two most important cities of the state of Lagash. A number of structures, including two temples, were investigated. A temple of Inanna, called the Ibgal, was located at the southwest edge of the city, while, at the highest point on the western side of the mound, a temple precinct called the Bagara was dedicated to Ningirsu, the patron god of Lagash. In the latter, there appears to have been a brewery, where beer was prepared for the ritual feeding of the deity. The site was largely abandoned after the Early Dynastic period, although religious buildings continued to be constructed at the site into the second millennium B.C.

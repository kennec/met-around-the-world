		<div class="Description">Umm el-Marra is located in western Syria on an east-west trade route that linked Aleppo and the Mediterranean with Mesopotamia. First excavated by a Belgian team in the 1970s, work on the site is currently being conducted by a joint expedition of Johns Hopkins University and the University of Amsterdam, which began in 1994 under the direction of Glenn M. Schwartz and Hans H. Curvers. The Metropolitan Museum of Art has provided support for the excavations at Umm el-Marra since 2006. Founded about 2700 B.C., the city flourished until about 2100 B.C., when, along with other cities of the region, it experienced a period of  decline. Occupation resumed in the Middle Bronze Age around 1900 B.C.; the last major occupation was in the Late Bronze Age, when Umm el-Marra became part of the Mitannian and then the Hittite empires. In 2000, excavators discovered the first tomb in a larger complex of burials dating from the mid- to late third millennium B.C. that have yielded metal weapons, gold, silver, and lapis jewelry, and other rich furnishings.

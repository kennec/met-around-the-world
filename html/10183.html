		<p class="title">Palace Museum–World Monuments Fund Qianlong Garden Conservation</p>
		<p class="venue">China, U.S.A.</p>
		<p class="date">2002–2019</p>
		<div class="Description">A Metropolitan Museum conservator is part of an international team of consultants that advises the World Monuments Fund in its work with the Palace Museum, Beijing, to develop a conservation program for the remarkable interiors and furniture preserved in the Qianlong Garden, the private retirement complex of Emperor Qianlong (r. 1736–95) in the Forbidden City. The site is an intimately scaled garden, covering two acres and comprising four courtyards, rockeries and grottoes, and twenty-seven buildings. Their original design and construction have survived relatively unaltered from the time they were constructed in 1771–76, and they have never been conserved before.
<br /><br />
While the site is under conservation, the loan exhibition, “The Emperor’s Private Paradise: Treasures from the Forbidden City,” provided the unique opportunity to study significant pieces of furniture, architectural elements, trompe l’oeil wall paintings, and religious and decorative art at the Metropolitan Museum (February–May, 2011), one of the American venues.
<br /><br />
Another important component of this project is the establishment of the first training program and facility in 2010 in the Forbidden City dedicated to the conservation of Chinese furniture and historic interiors, to benefit the Palace Museum and to serve as an international resource for the field.
<br /><br />
Made possible by World Monuments Fund.</div>

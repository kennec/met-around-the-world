		<div class="Description">In December 1909, in cooperation with Émile Baraize of the Egyptian Antiquities Service, the Metropolitan Museum began work at the temple of Hibis at Kharga in the desert west of Luxor. Excavations continued, with interruptions (including a long one caused by World War I), until 1939. Whereas Baraize mainly conducted excavations and architectural restoration, the members of the Metropolitan Museum concentrated on mapping, copying, and photographing the temple reliefs, a work chiefly undertaken by Museum Egyptologist Herbert E. Winlock, the artist Norman de Garis Davies, and Museum Egyptian Expedition photographer Harry Burton. As a result, the architecture and decoration of the temple were splendidly documented and published.
<br /><br />
The temple, mainly built or decorated under the rule of the Persian king Darius the Great (after 500 B.C.), is the only preserved Egyptian temple of the period between the end of the New Kingdom and the conquest by Alexander the Great. An entrance kiosk featuring slender columns with beautiful palm and composite capitals was added under King Nectanebo I (380–362 B.C.). The inscriptions and wall reliefs of the temple interior offer an extraordinary collection of material for the study of Late Period religious beliefs and practices. One of the capitals was purchased—before a reconstruction was thought feasible—for the Museum and can now be admired in the Dendur wing (10.177.2).
<br /><br />
The temple, heavily damaged after 1823, was well restored by Émile Baraize. Unfortunately, the rising groundwater has weakened the foundations since, necessitating a major rescue campaign, which is underway now. The Metropolitan Museum's work at Kharga established a precedent for the study and appreciation of the monumental heritage of the Egyptian oases.

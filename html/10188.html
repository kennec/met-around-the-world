		<div class="Description">The Valencia Institute for Conservation and Restoration of Cultural Heritage (IVC+R) invited a Metropolitan Museum textile conservator to teach a course in the methodology used by the Museum's Department of Textile Conservation. Funding was provided by the IVC+R. The one-week course is comprised of lectures and workshops. During the last three years, textile conservators from major conservation laboratories throughout Spain have participated. (There are plans to continue the project.) The prime objective of the course is to introduce the Spanish textile conservators to the Museum's principles, ethics, and practices of preservation, conservation, and display of textiles. These include the preventive conservation and maintenance of textile collections, analytical work and documentation, various types of conservation treatments, conservation materials, preparation for exhibition and display of textile collections, and textile storage.

Partnered with the Institut Valencià de Conservació i Restauració de Béns Culturals (Valencia Institute for Conservation and Restoration of Cultural Heritage).</div>

		<div class="Description"><strong>Background</strong>
<br /><br />
Malqata is the modern name for the site of a mudbrick palace-city built by the Dynasty 18 pharaoh Amenhotep III (ca. 1390–1353 B.C.) for the celebration of his first Heb-Sed, a rejuvenation festival that traditionally occurred in the thirtieth year of a king's reign and periodically thereafter. Amenhotep had three Heb-Seds and for each festival the structures were refurbished and the site expanded.
<br /><br />
In keeping with its purpose, the ancient name for the site was "the House of Rejoicing." It's modern name, Malqata, means a place where things are found, or picked up. This undoubtedly refers to the bits of painted pottery, glass, and faience that once littered the site—debris from Amenhotep's jubilees, each of which lasted for a number of months and included hundreds, if not thousands, of participants.
<br /><br />
Amenhotep's "House of Rejoicing" and the surrounding villages were used only for his three festivals and were largely abandoned after the king's death. The site was never built on again and the mudbrick structures gradually fell into ruin and were eventually covered with wind-blown debris from the yearly sandstorms that blow off the high desert (the Sahara) to the west.
<br /><br />
<strong>Excavations</strong>
<br /><br />
Malqata preserves the ruins of one of the few extensive town sites that survive from ancient Egyptian times. In 1910, the Egyptian Antiquities Service granted the Metropolitan Museum's Egyptian Expedition a concession to work at the site, which had been partially explored by two previous expeditions. Metropolitan Museum Egyptologist Herbert E. Winlock, Hugh G. Evelyn-White, and finally Ambrose Lansing supervised the excavations. Work continued for six field seasons, ending in 1920. The areas explored included the royal palaces and ceremonial buildings, villas of court officials, a temple dedicated to the god Amun, and villages inhabited by the hundreds of servants, tradesmen, and craftsmen needed to provide services and goods for the royal court.
<br /><br />
The Expedition's team of archaeologists and draftsmen produced plans of the structures, photographed the progress of the excavations, and published summaries of each season's work in the Museum's Bulletins. The archaeological finds included fragmentary paintings that had decorated the walls, ceilings, and floors of the palaces; distinctive blue-painted pottery; inscribed potshards and jar sealings; and raw materials for making glass vessels and faience jewelry that suggest nearby manufacture of these products. The Museum's share of these finds may be seen in Egyptian galleries 119 and 120.
<br /><br />
In 2008, the Department of Egyptian Art began a reexamination of the site.

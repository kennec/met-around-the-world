		<div class="Description">Tell Brak, in northeastern Syria, is one of the largest ancient mounds in northern Mesopotamia. The site lies at a strategic point that provided access to the north, particularly to Anatolia, with its metal sources, and also to the west, beyond the Euphrates, to the Mediterranean. Excavations at Tell Brak, which continue today, have yielded significant information about northern Mesopotamia over a great time span and have also served as the setting for new archaeological research and strategies. The British School of Archaeology in Iraq excavated the site for three seasons in 1937 and 1938, under the direction of Max E. L. Mallowan. Excavations resumed in 1976 sponsored by the Institute of Archaeology of University College London and from 1990 have been sponsored by the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research at the University of Cambridge. The Metropolitan Museum supported excavations at Tell Brak from 1983 to 1990 and then again in 1998 and 2000. Evidence for occupation at the site exists from the sixth millennium to the end of the Late Bronze Age in the second millennium B.C. In the third millennium B.C., Tell Brak was an important early urban center, known as the city of Nagar.

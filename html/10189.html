		<div class="Description">Gentile Bellini's important but much compromised Portrait of Caterina Cornaro, Queen of Cyprus, in the collection of the Szépművészeti Múzeum, Budapest, came to the Sherman Fairchild Center of Paintings Conservation at the Metropolitan Museum to undergo critical structural treatment. The painting's poplar support had been radically thinned in the late nineteenth century and a crude, fixed wooden cradle attached in an attempt to control the panel's response to fluctuations in relative humidity and impose a perfectly planar surface. Unfortunately, this intervention had caused the already delicate panel to develop new splits and pronounced deformations. The painting's appearance was also compromised by a number of severely discolored campaigns of retouching whose opaque and patchy appearance dominated the picture. In order to clarify the true condition of the support and facilitate a responsible structural treatment, it was necessary to remove existing overpaint and filling material so that splits could be realigned and consolidated. The painting underwent technical examination, cleaning, structural conservation, and restoration.

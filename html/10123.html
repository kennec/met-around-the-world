 				<p class="title">Romanian Museums / The Metropolitan Museum of Art Staff Exchange Program</p>
<p class="venue"></p> <p class="country">Romania</p> <p class="date">2006–present</p>		<div class="Description">The Romanian Museums / The Metropolitan Museum of Art Staff Exchange Program has provided participants—including directors, curators, and conservators—the opportunity to observe the ways in which museums are organized and to gain a better understanding of the conservation issues facing museums in Romania and the United States. A conservation workshop held at the Met on the restoration of the tapestry <em>Christ is Born as Man's Redeemer</em> (38.28) in the collection of The Cloisters brought four Romanian staff members to New York, including the director of the Ethnographic Museum in Moldavia. This intensive workshop culminated in a two-day textile symposium entitled "Redemption: Tapestry Preservation Past and Present."

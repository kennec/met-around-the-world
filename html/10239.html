 				<p class="title">Moroccan Court, Islamic Art Galleries, The Metropolitan Museum of Art</p>
<p class="venue"></p> <p class="country">Morocco</p> <p class="date">December 2010–October 2011</p>		<div class="Description">In preparation for the November 2011 opening of new galleries for its Islamic art collection, the Metropolitan Museum commissioned Arabesque, a company of Moroccan artisans based in Fez, to create a medieval Islamic courtyard. Work on the courtyard began in December 2010. The artisans of Arabesque, a company founded in 1928, are experts in traditional North African tile, plaster, and wood ornament, including the labor-intensive mosaic technique known as zellij. The overall design of the courtyard, which features re-creations of tile patterns and woodwork found in the Alhambra Palace in Granada and the fourteenth-century Attarin Madrasa in Fez, is a collaboration between Museum curators; Nadia Erzini, an art historian and curator at the Museum of Islamic Life in Tétouan, Morocco; and Achva Benzinberg Stein, professor of landscape architecture at City College with a specialty in Moroccan courts and gardens.</div>

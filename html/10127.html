 				<p class="title">Iraq Museum Residencies Program at The Metropolitan Museum of Art</p>
<p class="venue"></p> <p class="country">Iraq</p> <p class="date">2011</p> <p class="venue"></p> <p class="country">U.S.A.</p> <p class="date">2011</p>		<div class="Description">The Metropolitan Museum of Art was very pleased to host three directors from regional museums in Iraq as part of a joint program with the U.S. Department of State and the International Relief and Development NGO. Based in the Department of Ancient Near Eastern Art, this museum-wide project provided the participants with a broad understanding of the Metâ€™s operations, complemented by occasions for more detailed discussions and interactions in areas of particular interest.
<br /><br />
The month-long program was ultimately divided into four weeks, each focusing on a different area of museum work, namely curatorial, education and visitor experience, conservation and scientific research, and photographic and image storage.  All through the program the participants were also given the opportunity to go to a number of events connected to the opening of the new Islamic Galleries.
<br /><br />
By coming to the Metropolitan Museum, the participants were able to study the similarities, differences, and challenges that the Met and institutions in Iraq face, and discussed ways in which we can work together in the future. 
<br /><br />
This is an initiative of the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs at the U.S. Department of State.

		<div class="Description">On October 15, 1906, the Museum's Trustees established a Department of Egyptian Art and announced the organization of an Egyptian Expedition to conduct excavations in Egypt. For some time, the Egyptian government had granted excavation concessions to foreign institutions and shared the archaeological finds with excavators. Thanks to this generosity, more than half of the Egyptian collection at the Metropolitan Museum comes from its own excavations, which were conducted until 1936.
<br /><br />
As director of the excavations, the Trustees appointed Albert M. Lythgoe, curator of the Egyptian Department, who had extensive archaeological experience in Egypt and had been the first curator of Egyptian art in Boston. In January 1907, Lythgoe began work in the cemeteries at Lisht, a site famous for its two Middle Kingdom pyramids belonging to Amenemhat I and his son Senwosret I of Dynasty 12 (ca. 1981–1917 B.C.). Lythgoe's co-director was Arthur C. Mace, and they were assisted by Metropolitan Museum Egyptologist Herbert E. Winlock, who later succeeded Lythgoe as head of the Egyptian Department and eventually became Director of the Museum.
<br /><br />
In 1908, a concession was established at Kharga Oasis in an area with remains dating from Dynasty 27 (ca. 500 B.C.) to early Christian times. Almost thirty years later, in 1934, the Expedition began excavating at Hierakonpolis, one of the most important Predynastic sites in Egypt.

<strong>Excavations at Thebes</strong>
<br /><br />
In 1910, the Egyptian Antiquities Service granted the Museum a concession in western Thebes. Ancient Thebes (modern Luxor), on the east bank of the Nile, was the southern capital of Egypt and a great religious center, where the god Amun was worshipped. Across the river was the necropolis of western Thebes, one of the richest archaeological sites in the world. This vast area is best known for its cemeteries and royal mortuary temples that cover a period of more than two millennia. For twenty-six years, the Museum excavated monuments dating to the time of Mentuhotep II, founder of the Middle Kingdom (ca. 2010 B.C.); the female pharaoh Hatshepsut (ca. 1475 B.C.) and Amenhotep III (ca. 1350 B.C.) of Dynasty 18 in the New Kingdom; Dynasties 22–26 (ca. 945–525 B.C.); and the Early Christian or Byzantine period (A.D. 330–641/42).
<br /><br />
For many years, the excavations at Thebes were directed by Herbert Winlock assisted by Ambrose Lansing and, later, William C. Hayes. A significant aim of the work was to make as complete a record as possible, in photographs as well as notes and drawings. A Graphic Section of the Expedition was established in 1907 under Norman de Garis Davies, and in 1914, photographer Harry Burton joined the staff. The services of both Burton and Arthur Mace (from Lisht) were donated to Howard Carter after his discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb in 1922.

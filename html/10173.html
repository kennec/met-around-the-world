		<div class="Description">Tell Mozan, the ancient city of Urkesh, is located in northeastern Syria near the Turkish border. From about 3000 to 1500 B.C., Urkesh was an important stop on both the north-south trade route between Anatolia and the cities of Syria and Mesopotamia and the east-west route that linked the Mediterranean with the Zagros Mountains of western Iran. Excavations begun in 1984 under co-directors Giorgio Buccellati and Marilyn Kelly-Buccellati have revealed a temple terrace with a monumental stone staircase and a royal palace dated to the Akkadian period (ca. 2350–2200 B.C.). Urkesh was a capital of the Hurrian people, a little-understood but powerful group whose culture these buildings and associated finds have helped elucidate. The Metropolitan Museum of Art has provided support for the excavations since 2006.

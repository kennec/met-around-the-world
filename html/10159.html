		<div class="Description"><strong>The Tomb of Queen Merytamun (TT 65): The Burial of Nany</strong>
<br /><br />
In February 1929, while clearing the hillside north of Hatshesput's temple, the Museum's excavators came upon a roughly cut pit. Mudbrick blocking indicated the entrance to a tomb and when the bricks were removed, Museum Egyptologist Herbert E. Winlock and his colleagues saw a long corridor with a jumble of baskets, boxes, and pottery along one side. The tomb had clearly been used more than once, as these objects came from two distinct periods: the baskets were early New Kingdom (ca. 1500 B.C.); the boxes were from five centuries later in the early Third Intermediate Period (ca. 1000 B.C.).
<br /><br />
At the end of the corridor, where the tomb took a sharp turn to the right, lay a coffin containing an undisturbed mummy. The coffin's lid and a larger, outer coffin, lay farther inside the tomb at the edge of a deep well-like shaft. The coffins were inscribed for Nany, a daughter of the High Priest of Amun and titular king Painedjem I of Dynasty 21. The gold elements on Nany's coffins had been removed, but her burial was largely intact and included a magnificent Book of the Dead papyrus. The papyrus and other objects received in the division of finds are on view in Egyptian gallery 126.
<br /><br />
<strong>The Burial of Queen Merytamun</strong>
<br /><br />
After Nany's burial, equipment was removed and boards were used to span the well. Beyond were two undecorated rooms, the second of which held a huge, beautifully carved, anthropoid (human-shaped) coffin inscribed for Queen Merytamun, who was probably the principal wife and sister of Amenhotep I of early Dynasty 18. Inside was a second, much smaller coffin that held the beautifully wrapped mummy of the queen. An inscription on the outer shroud stated that her burial had been "examined" on a specific date in year 19 of an unnamed king. Winlock eventually identified this king as Painedjem I (Nany's father), who ruled some 500 years after Merytamun's death.
<br /><br />
Investigation of the mummy revealed what the ancient "examination" had entailed: careful unwrapping; removal of the gold jewelry (which left impressions on the inner wrappings); and rewrapping with new linen. This apparently official (and respectful) recycling of material wealth was very different from the more destructive acts of tomb robbers and shed an interesting light on the actions of Dynasty 21 officials.
<br /><br />
The location of Merytamun's tomb was undoubtedly remembered when Painedjem's daughter, Nany, died in her late seventies. Tomb reuse occurred frequently in western Thebes, where the cemeteries and temples were in use for several thousand years.
<br /><br />
The majority of objects from Merytamun's royal burial were retained by the Egyptian Antiquities Service in the division of finds, but several baskets and an interesting human-shaped shroud came to the Museum and are on display in Egyptian gallery 116.

 				<p class="title">The Moscow Kremlin / The Metropolitan Museum of Art Staff Exchange Program</p>
<p class="venue"></p> <p class="country">Russia</p> <p class="date">2005â€“present</p>		<div class="Description">The Moscow Kremlin / The Metropolitan Museum of Art Staff Exchange Program provides opportunities to view and study the extraordinary collections of paintings, sculpture, antiquities, decorative arts, arms, armor, and costume found at both institutions. One Met staff participant was able to view examples of unpublished seventeenth- and eighteenth-century silver that are in excellent condition. These objects retain details that have changed the discussion among experts in the field of silver and have brought together colleagues who will be continuing the dialogue and working collaboratively in the future.

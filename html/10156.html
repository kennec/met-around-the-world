		<div class="Description">The Middle Kingdom temple of the Dynasty 11 king Mentuhotep II Nebhepetre at Deir el-Bahri (ca. 2051–2000 B.C.) is one of a handful of pioneering achievements that shaped ancient Egyptian architecture, comparable to the Step Pyramid complex of Djoser at Saqqara (ca. 2640 B.C.) or the temple of Hatshepsut at Deir el-Bahri (ca. 1470 B.C.). Constructed on two levels and surrounded by open pillared halls, this temple became the prototype for Egyptian temples of the New Kingdom.
<br /><br />
The monument was first excavated in 1903 to 1907 by Edouard Naville for the British Egypt Exploration Fund. In 1910, the area of the temple complex became an essential part of the concession of the Metropolitan Museum. When Metropolitan Museum Egyptologist Herbert E. Winlock began his exploration of the temple in 1920, only some specific and more meticulous projects were left to be carried out. Nevertheless, during five field seasons (ending in 1931), important discoveries were made, such as the tomb shafts of the two Dynasty 11 princesses Myt and Aashyt; the foundation deposits under the temple platform; and the ancient tree grove in front of the temple. 
<br /><br />
Important objects from the burials of the princesses, together with examples of the architecture and decoration of the temple, are now on display in the Museum's Egyptian galleries 104 and 105. They include one of the sandstone statues of the king, found in the area of the temple grove. Winlock's work in the temple did not lead to a final documentation of the monument. But his studies of the temple and of the Dynasty 11 cemeteries surrounding it produced, besides many other achievements, his 1947 publication The Rise and Fall of the Middle Kingdom in Thebes, a relatively small book that became an eye-opener for a whole generation of Egyptologists who, for the first time, discovered the importance of Thebes for the study of the Middle Kingdom, a major phase of Egyptian culture. Since then, more work has been carried out on the temple, but it has not yet been restored and is not open to visitors.

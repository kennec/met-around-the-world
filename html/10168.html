		<div class="Description">Merv, in southeastern Turkmenistan, was the principal city in a large oasis on the famed Silk Road, the major trade route that stretched from Rome to China. Since 1890, the site has been excavated intermittently by the Russians, the Americans, and the Soviets. In 1992, the National Institute for the History of Turkmenistan, the Institute of Archaeology of University College London, and the British Museum collaborated to create the International Merv Project, renamed the Ancient Merv Project in 2001. The Metropolitan Museum provided support from 1998 to 2001. The site was occupied in the sixth century B.C. during the Achaemenid period. The Seleucid ruler Antiochus I (r. 281–261 B.C.) turned Merv into a metropolis with a fortified citadel, known as Erk Kala. Its walled city, Antiochus Margiana (now called Gyaur Kala), flourished throughout the following Parthian and Sasanian periods (ca. 200 B.C.–A.D. 650), growing rich on the revenues of the trade flowing along the east-west highway. Sometime in the eighth century, a suburb grew up outside the walls of Gyaur Kala to the west. This new suburb developed into the walled city of Sultan Kala, which became the principal eastern capital of the great Seljuq empire.

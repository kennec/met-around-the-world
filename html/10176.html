		<div class="Description">The Amorium Excavations Project began in 1987 with a preliminary survey season. A full-scale program of excavation, conservation, and research commenced in 1988. A Metropolitan Museum curator in the Department of Greek and Roman Art is the director of the Amorium Excavations Project.
<br /><br />
The site, located in the village of Hisarköy, Turkey, comprises a large prehistoric man-made mound, a fortified lower city, and an extensive necropolis. Occupation has been attested for the Early Bronze Age and the Phrygian, Hellenistic, and Roman periods, but Amorium attained its greatest prominence during the seventh through eleventh centuries A.D., when it became a major provincial center and military headquarters. 
<br /><br />
The excavations have provided ample evidence for the fact that it was one of the few cities in Anatolia that continued to flourish under the Byzantines. It was also the hometown of a short-lived dynasty of Byzantine emperors in the ninth century—that of Michael II, his son Theophilus, and his grandson Michael III. The most famous event in the city’s history took place in A.D. 838 during Theophilus’ reign, when the city was attacked and, after a twelve-day siege, was captured and sacked by Arab forces led by the Abbasid caliph al-Mu‛tasim. Startling evidence of the destruction was uncovered in 2008, when the remains of two bodies—apparently victims of the siege—were unearthed. In addition, stretches of the fortification walls, a large church, a bathhouse, and several industrial installations, including wine presses, have been uncovered.

		<div class="Description">Located in the center of the southern Mesopotamian floodplain, the city of Nippur had a special function as the great holy city in which Enlil, the supreme god of the Sumerian pantheon, resided. Since archaeological fieldwork began in Iraq in the mid-nineteenth century, excavations have been conducted at Nippur. The first American expedition to work in Iraq excavated Nippur between 1888 and 1900 under the sponsorship of the University of Pennsylvania. In 1948, the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago and the University Museum of the University of Pennsylvania formed a Joint Expedition to reopen excavations at Nippur. After the University of Pennsylvania withdrew in 1952, the University of Chicago continued the excavations until 1962 in partnership with the Baghdad School of the American Schools of Oriental Research. During the 1957–58 and 1960–61 seasons, the Metropolitan Museum also contributed funds to the Expedition and received a share of the finds. The archaeological remains of Nippur are unparalleled and span more than 6,000 years, from the beginning of the Ubaid period (ca. 5500–4000 B.C.) to about A.D. 800 in the Islamic period. Excavations of the temple of the goddess Inanna provide the longest continuous archaeological sequence for a Mesopotamian site, with more than twenty building levels dating back into the Uruk period of the fourth millennium B.C.

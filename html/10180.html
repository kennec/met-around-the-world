		<div class="Description">ConservationSpace is one of several information technology initiatives supported by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to benefit the museums and scholars and to facilitate collaboration across disciplines and domains. The goal of ConservationSpace is to develop an open-source software application that will address a core need of the conservation community for a shared digital approach to managing its documentation, improve continuity in procedures, increase access, expand research opportunities, and better ensure the preservation of conservation documentation. A first meeting, in early March 2009, at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, and a second, in early April 2009, at the National Gallery, London, marked the beginnings of this large international partnership to design and build a conservation documentation system. Representatives from each of the conservation departments and conservators embedded in curatorial departments at the Metropolitan Museum have been working on this initiative.
<br /><br />
Partners include The British Museum, Indianapolis Museum of Art, Museum of the Moving Image, National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., Statens Museum for Kunst, Copenhagen, and Yale University.

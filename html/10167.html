		<div class="Description">The site of Jujah, in the Wadi Hadhramaut of Yemen, was excavated in 1994 and 1995 under the direction of Donald P. Hansen of the Institute of Fine Arts of New York University with support from the Metropolitan Museum. In one area, a large, private residential complex with ground-level and basement storage areas was uncovered. The size of the foundation stones and the thickness of the outer walls suggest that the building was at least two stories high. In a second area, beneath another residential structure, was a temple that in its earliest phase had plastered and painted walls. Visible in the polychrome murals that once decorated the cella, or inner sanctum, were fragmentary depictions of human and birdlike figures, textile patterns, and a partial inscription in South Arabian script. Carbon 14 dates for the earliest levels of the so-called Painted Temple fall between the late ninth and seventh centuries B.C.

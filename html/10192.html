		<p class="title">Conservation of Gossart's <em>The Mocking of Christ</em> and <em>Portrait of a Man</em></p>
		<p class="venue">Belgium, Hungary</p>
		<p class="date">2009–2010</p>
		<div class="Description">These two paintings were cleaned and restored in preparation for the Metropolitan Museum's major monographic exhibition <em>Man, Myth, and Sensual Pleasures: Jan Gossart's Renaissance</em>. Both paintings had been in storage in their respective museums because their appearance was severely distorted by discolored varnish and liberal overpainting. However, during preparatory research, their quality was recognized by the exhibition's curator and, following extensive technical examination and treatment in the paintings conservation center, they have been acknowledged as important autograph works by Gossart. Of particular note was the recovery of the ultramarine blue drapery in <em>The Mocking of Christ</em> (Budapest). In the <em>Portrait of a Man</em> (Antwerp), the erroneous coat of arms, which had been added at a much later date, was suppressed with retouching in order to recover the original spatial relationship between the sitter and the background.

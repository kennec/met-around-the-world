		<p class="date">1907–1934, 1984–1989</p>
		<div class="Description">Senwosret I's pyramid complex was first excavated by French Egyptologists in 1894–95 led by J.-E. Gautier. The Metropolitan Museum worked at the site for nine seasons between 1907 and 1934; the excavations were led by Museum curator Albert Lythgoe, Ambrose Lansing, and Arthur Mace. Metropolitan Museum excavations resumed between 1984 and 1989, in an effort to enhance understanding of the previously excavated material and investigate other parts of the site. Objects in the Museum that originate from the Senwosret I complex are found in galleries 109, 110, and 113. They include relief blocks from Senwosret I's pyramid temple, north chapel, and causeway, portions of the complex's enclosure wall, a drainspout in the form of a lion's head, and statues of the king and high officials.
<br /><br />
Senwosret I (ca. 1961–1917 B.C.), the son and successor of Amenemhat I, built his pyramid complex about one mile to the south of his father's monument at Lisht. Access to Senwosret I's burial chambers was through a sloping passage on the north side of the pyramid; the chambers have been filled with groundwater since at least the nineteenth century and are therefore unexplored. On the east side of the pyramid was a large limestone temple with a complex series of rooms decorated with reliefs. Surrounding the king's pyramid were nine smaller pyramids built for queens and princesses; the largest belonged to a woman named Neferu, who was likely Senwosret I's mother. A long, decorated causeway connected the desert pyramid complex to the cultivated land.
<br /><br />
Beyond the enclosure walls of the pyramid complex were numerous tombs built by the high officials and other residents of Itj-tawy, Egypt's capital in the Middle Kingdom. Among the most important tombs was that of a man named Senwosretankh, who had a long series of religious texts carved into the walls of his burial chamber. The mastaba of Imhotep included two beautiful wood figures dressed in royal garments. The tomb of the vizier Mentuhotep, discovered in 1988, contained one of the most stunning painted sarcophagi of the Middle Kingdom.
<br /><br />
Senwosret I's complex shows clearly that architects had closely examined pyramid complexes dating to the end of the Old Kingdom. In particular, architectural features and elements of wall decoration were directly inspired by these earlier prototypes. The Senwosret I complex marks a moment of archaism and retrospection before the changes that occur later in the Middle Kingdom. These transformations are particularly apparent in the pyramid complex of Senwosret III at Dahshur, site of an ongoing Metropolitan Museum excavation.

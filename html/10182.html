		<p class="title">Conservation assessment of museums and storerooms in Cyrene, Libya</p>
		<p class="venue">Libya, U.S.A.</p>
		<p class="date">Januaryâ€“February 2010</p>
		<div class="Description">The Libyan Department of Antiquities invited two conservators from the Metropolitan Museum to assess the condition of objects on exhibition and in storage at the ancient Greek city of Cyrene (today Shahat), Libya, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This assessment is part of the Cyrenaica Archaeological Project directed by Professor Susan Kane of Oberlin College and was funded by a U.S. Department of State Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation grant. The overall project also includes training in the documentation and management of archaeological sites and collections. The Met team made a detailed tour of all departmental facilities in Cyrene and outlined plans for a number of future initiatives, including the improvement (through the design and construction of more efficient shelving) of one storage area within the museum building for important and highly valuable objects; the creation of another storage area in an under-utilized area of the museum; prioritization of objects for possible conservation treatment; the donation of conservation supplies and equipment; and the training of Libyan museum staff through short-term visits to the Met to learn about best practices in exhibition design, educational outreach, museum security, etc. The current unrest in Libya has brought these plans to a halt, but the team remains committed to the project and ready to return when the time is right.

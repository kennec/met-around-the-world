		<p class="title">Conservation assistance to the National Museum of Afghanistan</p>
		<p class="venue">Afghanistan, U.S.A.</p>
		<p class="date">2009–2010</p>
		<div class="Description">During the summer of 2009, when <em>Afghanistan: Hidden Treasures from the National Museum, Kabul</em> was on view at the The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Abdullah Hakimzada, a conservator at the National Museum of Afghanistan, resided in New York as an official representative of his institution. Museum staff in Afghanistan have performed heroic efforts to safeguard their nation's cultural heritage during the years of recent conflict and Metropolitan Museum conservators were eager to learn about Mr. Hakimzada's work and provide assistance. Over the course of the summer, Mr. Hakimzada visited several of the Metropolitan's conservation departments and discussed new techniques that might be useful in his work. After a moving slide presentation of his efforts in which he mentioned the difficulty of obtaining even basic supplies, Metropolitan staff resolved to send a large number of these urgently needed items to his institution. The shipment included adhesives, environmental monitoring equipment, tools, laboratory safety supplies, and a set of acrylic paints generously donated by Golden Artists Colors, Inc. This material, sent to Kabul with the assistance of the U.S. State Department, was received by Dr. Massoudi, director of the National Museum in June 2010. Now that professional contacts have been established, Metropolitan Museum conservators look forward to future collaborations with the National Museum.
